# fully

`fully` is a full solution for full stack with `react` and `koa` ,with `fully` you can easily start a `CMS project` , with `SSR`,`content manager`,`code generator`.Notice that , `fully` dons't help you build a website or an application , it's only starter , with some `built-in` libraries *(which I think would pretty fit for most people)*,you can build you web application yourself easily .If everything `fully` used dose not trouble you , `fully` will be a perfect foundationï¼Œotherwise you can fork it and make it yourself.
